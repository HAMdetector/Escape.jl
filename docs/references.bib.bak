  abstract        = {Immunogenic peptides of human tumor Ag have been used to generate antigen-specific CTL. However, the vast majority of these peptide-specific CTL clones are of low avidity and are peptide, but not tumor, reactive. Peptide-MHC tetramers have been shown to bind specific TCRs with sufficient affinity to be useful reagents for flow cytometry. In this paper we demonstrate that peptide-MHC tetramers can also be used to selectively identify high avidity tumor-reactive CTL and enrich, from a heterogeneous population, the subpopulation of peptide-reactive T cells that can lyse tumor targets. The melanoma proteins, MART-1 and gp100, were used to induce potentially tumor-reactive T cells, and the intensity of T cell staining by TCR binding of specific peptide-MHC tetramers was assessed. A range of fluorescence intensity was detected, and the magnitude of tetramer binding was correlated with T cell avidity. The population of peptide-reactive T cells was phenotypically similar with regard to expression of TCR and adhesion molecules, suggesting that this differential avidity for tumor cells reflected differential affinity of the TCR for its peptide-MHC ligand. Sorting, cloning, and expansion of tetramerhigh CTL from a heterogeneous population of peptide-stimulated PBMCs enabled rapid selection of high avidity tumor-reactive CTL clones, which retained their functional and tetramerhigh phenotype on re-expansion. These results demonstrate that the avidity of a T cell for its tumor target is due to the specific affinity of the TCR for its peptide-MHC ligand, that this interaction can be described using peptide-MHC tetramers and used to isolate high avidity tumor-reactive CTL.},

  abstract     = {The horseshoe prior has proven to be a noteworthy alternative for sparse Bayesian estimation, but as shown in this paper, the results can be sensitive to the prior choice for the global shrinkage hyperparameter. We argue that the previous default choices are dubious due to their tendency to favor solutions with more unshrunk coefficients than we typically expect a priori. This can lead to bad results if this parameter is not strongly identified by data. We derive the relationship between the global parameter and the effective number of nonzeros in the coefficient vector, and show an easy and intuitive way of setting up the prior for the global parameter based on our prior beliefs about the number of nonzero coefficients in the model. The results on real world data show that one can benefit greatly -- in terms of improved parameter estimates, prediction accuracy, and reduced computation time -- from transforming even a crude guess for the number of nonzero coefficients into the prior for the global parameter using our framework.},

Unfortunately, that understanding is confined within the mathematics of differential geometry which has limited its dissemination, especially to the applied communities for which it is particularly important. In this review I provide a comprehensive conceptual account of these theoretical foundations, focusing on developing a principled intuition behind the method and its optimal implementations rather of any exhaustive rigor. Whether a practitioner or a statistician, the dedicated reader will acquire a solid grasp of how Hamiltonian Monte Carlo works, when it succeeds, and, perhaps most importantly, when it fails.},
